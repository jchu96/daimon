"""Domain state and wire grammar for the multi-step wizard.

This module lives in `daimon.core`, not in either adapter, for the same
reason `daimon.core.credential_requests` does: the MCP server (which posts
a wizard's first screen) and the Discord bot (which dispatches every tap on
it) cannot import each other, so the shared encode/decode logic has to sit
one level up.

Discord's `DynamicItem` dispatch matches an incoming `custom_id` with
`pattern.fullmatch`, not a prefix search, and — critically — it fires
*every* registered dynamic-item template whose pattern fullmatches, with no
early break once one has matched. Two overlapping templates therefore
double-dispatch a single tap. That is why `NAV_CUSTOM_ID_PATTERN`,
`SELECT_CUSTOM_ID_PATTERN`, and `SUBMIT_CUSTOM_ID_PATTERN` must be provably
pairwise disjoint, and why `build_custom_id` refuses to mint an id that
neither pattern would route.

There are THREE templates, not one, because three different widget classes
dispatch them in the bot process: ordinary navigation and option buttons
(`NAV_CUSTOM_ID_PATTERN`), the multi-select component (`SELECT_CUSTOM_ID_PATTERN`),
and the submit button (`SUBMIT_CUSTOM_ID_PATTERN`), which is routed
separately so the turn-spawning path has its own isolated dispatch entry
point rather than sharing one with ordinary navigation. A button item and a
select item are different discord.py `DynamicItem` subclasses, so the
button and select grammars in particular must be provably disjoint from
each other: the `_sel` action suffix appears only in
`SELECT_CUSTOM_ID_TEMPLATE` and nowhere in `NAV_CUSTOM_ID_TEMPLATE`, so a
select tap can never accidentally dispatch the button item class (or vice
versa).

The `wz:` prefix is deliberately disjoint from `daimon.core.credential_requests`'
`ztc:` prefix and from the sibling message-feedback feature's `mfb:` prefix
(when that module exists) — no wizard custom_id can ever fullmatch another
feature's dispatch pattern, and no other feature's custom_id can fullmatch
one of these.

A `WizardState.current_step` equal to `len(spec.steps)` (one past the last
real step index) means the review screen — the summary-and-submit screen
shown after every question has an answer, not a step in `spec.steps` itself.
