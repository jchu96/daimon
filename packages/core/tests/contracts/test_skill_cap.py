"""Contract probe for the provider's real per-agent skill limit.

The Discord panel and the chat update path enforce a shared product cap,
``daimon.core.constants.AGENT_SKILL_CAP``, deliberately set below the
provider's own per-agent limit. That provider limit is not hardcoded
anywhere in this codebase because it has moved before: a code comment once
recorded 20 as the observed ceiling, and a later run attached 21 skills to a
single agent successfully. Hardcoding a second number invites exactly that
kind of silent staleness.

This probe re-establishes the provider's current limit on demand instead of
trusting a stale citation: it attaches more skills than any previously
observed ceiling to one agent, reads the provider's own rejection message,
and extracts the number from it with the same phrasing match
``daimon.core.skill_sync.orchestrator._looks_like_skill_cap`` already uses
in production. Run it whenever the product cap needs re-justifying:

    uv run pytest packages/core/tests/contracts/test_skill_cap.py -m contract

Unrun in this environment (no ``DAIMON_TEST_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``) as of this
plan's execution — see the plan's summary for the operator follow-up.
