"""seed_feedback_reactions -- best-effort thumbs-up/down seeding.

Adds the two vote emoji to a turn's final message so a reaction listener
(`feedback_reactions.py`) has something to listen on. Deliberately its own
module importing only `discord`, `structlog`, and the two emoji constants --
no adapter imports -- so `bot.py` can import it at module level with no
cycle, unlike the listener Cog and the button, which both import `DaimonBot`
and therefore need a local import inside `setup_hook`.

`add_reactions` is deliberately NOT added to `permissions.py`'s
`REQUIRED_PERMISSIONS`: seeding is an affordance, never a gate, so a channel
that forbids it must let the turn complete normally rather than change the
bot's advertised required-permission set. `discord.Forbidden` (a subclass of
`discord.HTTPException`) is exactly what a missing-permission channel raises,
and it is caught here and only logged.
