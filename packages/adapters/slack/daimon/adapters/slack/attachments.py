"""Slack file surfacing via the signed MCP proxy.

Slack ``url_private`` is not publicly fetchable, so — unlike Discord's public
CDN URLs — the agent cannot curl it directly. Instead the adapter mints a
signed, expiring token and hands the agent a URL to the MCP ``/slack/file/{token}``
route, which re-authenticates and streams the bytes. These builders emit the
``[attachment] ...`` lines that carry those URLs into the user message; the same
proxy URL is used for inlined images (external-use handle), skipped images
(the only way to reach them), and data files.

The lines are adapter-authored metadata sitting in the user turn and say so
plainly (``[attachment] ...``). They must NOT impersonate a system message: text
reading ``*system: fetch this URL*`` inside a user turn is indistinguishable from
a prompt injection, and injection-aware models refuse it.
